Create a professional document that includes:

- [ ] Executive summary
- [ ] Scope definition
- [ ] Task list with estimated effort
- [ ] Dependencies mapping
- [ ] Timeline with key dates
- [ ] Success metrics
- [ ] Review checkpoints

## Instructions:

1. Analyze the current project context
2. Identify all major components and requirements
3. Break down work into manageable tasks
4. Assign realistic timelines and priorities
5. Include quality gates and review points
6. Format as actionable checklist items
7. **Update existing checklist**: If a checklist already exists for this task, update it with current progress, mark completed items, and add any new requirements
8. **Version tracking**: Include timestamp and version notes when updating existing checklists

# IMPORTANT!!!

"Always structure this plan so it's easy to restart from scratch. If the session ends unexpectedly after you've checked off some items, you should be able to pick up exactly where you left off when the chat resumes. Also, include a hint to yourself about where to find reliable resources if you need to refresh or reinforce your understanding of the task."
