## üìã Component Categories

The library organizes components into these categories:

- **Forms** (37 components): Input fields, validation, form controls, file uploads
- **UI** (29 components): Cards, buttons, tables, charts, dialogs, dropdowns
- **Auth** (12 components): Authentication, session management, user handling
- **Status** (11 components): Error states, notifications, loading indicators

- **Cursors** (5 components): Custom cursor effects and animations
- **Tabs** (3 components): Tab navigation and content
- **Library** (1 component): Utility components and integrations

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Finding Components
1. **Start with search**: Use `mcp__search_components` to find relevant components
2. **Get details**: Use `mcp__get_component_docs` for specific components
3. **Generate code**: Use `mcp__generate_code` to create working examples

### Building Features
1. **Get recommendations**: Use `mcp__recommend_components` for feature suggestions
2. **Review options**: Present multiple component options to the user
3. **Generate implementation**: Create complete code examples with `mcp__generate_code`

### Troubleshooting
1. **Use integration help**: `mcp__integration_help` for setup issues
2. **Check documentation**: `mcp__get_component_docs` for component-specific problems
3. **Provide alternatives**: Use `mcp__recommend_components` for different approaches

## üîç Best Practices

### Search Strategies
- Use descriptive terms: "form validation" instead of just "form"
- Include functionality: "button with loading state" instead of just "button"
- Try category filters when searches return too many results

### Code Generation
- Always include TypeScript by default unless user specifies otherwise
- Use appropriate patterns (form, dashboard, etc.) based on user needs
- Include multiple components when building complete features

### Documentation
- Always include examples when getting component docs
- Explain props and their purposes
- Provide context about when to use each component

## üöÄ Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: User Wants to Build a Login Form
1. `mcp__recommend_components` with description="user login form with validation"
2. `mcp__get_component_docs` for recommended components
3. `mcp__generate_code` with authentication pattern
4. `mcp__integration_help` if user has setup questions

### Workflow 2: User Needs a Data Table
1. `mcp__search_components` with query="table data" and category="UI"
2. `mcp__get_component_docs` for table components
3. `mcp__generate_code` with dashboard pattern
4. Provide styling and customization tips

### Workflow 3: User Has Installation Issues
1. `mcp__integration_help` with topic="troubleshooting"
2. `mcp__integration_help` with topic="dependencies"
3. Provide step-by-step installation guide
4. `mcp__get_component_docs` for simple component to test setup
